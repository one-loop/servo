# üåé ServO
An app that connects personal service providers to clients
This app was built using glide apps, which uses google sheets to construct apps.

## üìï Description of Problem and Solution
- Personal service providers and local businesses are finding it harder to market and sell their services, especially with COVID-19
therefore, I tried to solve this issue by creating an app that lets them do this easily. 
- Although there are already Apps that allow users to sell their services online like fiverr or upwork, these apps weren't designed for local
services and in person services like mechanics, carpenters, plumbers, lawyers, web designers, cleaners etc.
- Clients can find service providers based on their ratings and can order services. This also makes it easy for
clients to quickly and easily find service providers in their local area without having to flip through phone books.
- When I was creating this app, I wanted it to be specifically catered towards helping local service providers and small
businesses in selling their services just like postmates or uber eats helping local restaurants sell their food despite of COVID.
- This app would be especially useful to people who don't have access to PayPay or credit cards (e.g. in developing countries) to make online transactions, because
many of the services can be done in person and don't need online transactions. It simply is just an app to connect service providers with clients quickly and easily

## üëá Installation
1. You can open the app in either your browser, or install it on a phone
2. Go on [this link](https://tasty-mask-4026.glideapp.io/) to visit the app on the browser. It should display an iPhone screen, you may need to zoom out if the proportions of the app aren't fitting to the screen
3. To install the app on your phone, scan the qr code which will open the app on the phone browser. If you're using iOS, visit the app link on **safari**, click share and add to home screen. On android, click the install button in the top right of the browser and it should install the app to your home screen
4. You can now open and play around with the app. The app is just a prototype for a possible app, so the users on the app are just dummy accounts. 
5. If you want to see the inner workings of the app, send me an email (ssifa70423atkes.edu.kw) and I will add you as a member of the project so you can view the app

## üìí Notes
- This was a hackathon project, it is not 100% complete and ready for deploying as I did not have enough time to, but I will be sure to add more features and work on improving and hopefully deploying this app in the future
- Contributers to the project are welcome if you have feature requests or issues, create an issue
- Creating a fully fledged app in 24 Hours would not have been possible if I didn't use glide apps, especially not alone. It makes making an app much faster and easier, so I could focus more time on the actual idea and solution.
